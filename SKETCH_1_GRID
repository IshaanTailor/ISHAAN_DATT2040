SKETCH 1: GRIDS
LAST EDIT: SEPT 16, 2022
DUE DATE:  SEPT 16 2022
DESC: In this sketc, I took some ideas from some of the examples and included some of my own aswell. 
      For example I have the random dice effect to switch colour, but instead of creating a line it creates either a 
      circle or a square with a random colour. A grid of 16 by 16 shapes show up and there are different coloured sections
      instead of just random colours everywhere. This was my first time working with Processing and I'm getting used to using it
*/

//Define the how many rows and columns there are
int cols = 16;
int rows = 16;

//variables to hold stepsize (spacing in the grid)
int stepx, stepy;

//variables to store the num and dice integers
int num = 0;
int dice = 0;

//setup of the canvas
void setup() {
  size(600, 600);
  
  //value of step sizes
  stepx = (width / cols);
  stepy = (height / rows);
  
  //don't loop
  noLoop();
}


//drawing loop -- keeps the sketch running in realtime
void draw() {
  //set background to dark gray
  background(30);
  
  //loop through all boxes
  for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
      float x = i*stepx+15;
      float y = j*stepy+15;
      
      //randomize stroke weight and which shape
      strokeWeight(random(10));
      int shape = int(random(2));
      
      //keep adding to num everytime to have sections of colours
      if (num < 600)
      {
        num++;
      }
